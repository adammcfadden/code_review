#Word Counter

This program contains the word_counter method, and a Sinatra app that will deploy the program and allow the user to interact.

The app will allow the user to input their **search word** and **sentence**, click **submit** and have the results returned to them.

The word_counter method will take a **search word** input and a **sentence** input. It will count and return how many times the **search word** occurs in the **sentence**.

>Example:
>Input Search Word = Blue
>Input Sentence =  The blue dog goes to the Blue house.
>Output = 2

The app can be visited here *https://fast-sierra-7122.herokuapp.com/*

Requirements:

- Ruby 2.2.0
- Rubygems, Bundler
- Sinatra
- Capybara - for testing

Bootstrap css is used in the app.
